# Top_Youtube_Channels_Exploratory_data_analysis

This notebook is based on the [Top 5000 Youtube channels data from Socialblade.](https://www.kaggle.com/mdhrumil/top-5000-youtube-channels-data-from-socialblade)

This notebook contains data analysis on the Socialblade's data of top 5000 Youtube Channels. I have mainly relied only on Exploratory Data Analysis in this project. The main motives of doing this project:

* I am quite comfortable in doing predictive and mathematical analysis on various datasets, but felt the need to practice the art of Exploratory Data Analysis. Hence I have relied only on it in this project.
* The current hype surrounding Youtube also caused curiosity within me as to how the various features affect the number of subscribers of a channel and in general, how these features interact with each other.
* I have tried including various statistical concepts in the project.
